    "In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be\n",
    "integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.\n",

    "\n",
    "-87.8 , 6 , 'hello' are values (floating point,integer,string respectively\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "      variables are something that we use to store certain values or strings or any kind of informations. variable names has         some rules in python\n",
    "      strings are some collection of letters or numbers usually we mention inbetween \"\" , '' eg: \"python\",'python'\n",

    "3. Describe three different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "      three main data types in python are\n",
    "      integer (5, 10, 2) - decared as int\n",
    "      floating point (5.25, 8.0 )- declared as float\n",
    "      string (\"itsmy_program\",'helloworld') - declared as str\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "\n",
    "    expressions are some kind of combination of values and operators .an expression should be evaluated and must return a value     (including True or False)\n",
    "\n",
    "     eg : 2+2\n",
    "        5%3\n",

    " 5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an\n",
    "expression and a statement?       \n",
    "\n",
    "      assignment statements are meant to assign some certain values to a variable for storing that value for further uses\n",
    "      but expressions are the combination of values and operators(or a specific function) which should return a value\n",
    "\n",
    "        \n",
    "6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?\n",
    "bacon = 22\n",
    "bacon + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "       answer:\n",
    "       bacon will contain the same value ie 22\n",
    "       if we need to add 1 to the variable bacon , there should be an assignmnet expression\n",
    "       bacon= bacon+1  or bacon+=1\n",
    "    \n",
    "7. What should the values of the following two terms be?\n",
    "'spam' + 'spamspam'\n",
    "'spam' * 3\n",
    "\n",
    "       values of both terms will be spamspamspam \n",
    "    \n",
    "8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "      there are certain conditions for assigning a variable name in python. variable name should not be numbers and should not       start with a number either  (can start with an underscore or a letter)\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?\n",
    "\n",
    "     answer:\n",
    "     int(value) - to ghet the integer version\n",
    "     float(value) - to get the floating point value\n",
    "     str(value) - to get the string version\n",
    "     \n",
    "10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?\n",
    "'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "     answer:\n",
    "     \n",
    "     99 is an integer value and it can not be concatenated with string values\n",
    "     \n",
    "     we can use it like this 'I have eaten ' + '99' + ' burritos'. there are more methods though like string formatting\n",
